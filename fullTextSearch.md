# Full Text Search 


  Full-text search is a technique used in information retrieval and
       database systems to search and retrieve documents or records that
       contain a specific set of words or phrases . It allows us to
       search for documents or text data based on the actual content of
       the documents,
       
   When we have a lot of information that we need to search through
       quickly, we can use tools like Elasticsearch, Solr, or Lucene.
       These tools make it easier to find specific things in databases. 
       
       
  -  **Elasticsearch**: 
     - It helps us  search through lots of data really quickly.
     - Elasticsearch is also  known for its real-time search capabilities and horizontal scalability
     - It is  built on Lucene, but it's more than just a search engine
     - It is an good choice for applications that require quick and distributed search functionalities.
           
   -  **Solr**: 
      - It is  similar to Elasticsearch  and  like a ready-to-use search platform built on top of Lucene.  
      - Solr helps us search through data quickly and efficiently and highly focused for its fault tolerance and near-real-time
       indexing .
      - It's good for finding specific things in a lot of information.
          
  -  **Lucene** :
      - It is  Java-based, open-source search library .
      -  It is like the building block for Elasticsearch and Solr. 
      - Lucene is a software library that helps other programs quickly find specific words or phrases within a large amount of
       text. It's not something we use directly, but it's what makes
       search engines and other search tools work so well.
           
       
   To determine  which one to use, we  think about what our project
       needs, how much data we have, and how quickly we need to find
       things. So basically it depends on our project and database
       requriement.
